Sass is a fantastic tool to help CSS developers write more robust, easily maintainable CSS code. In this chapter
you will learn how easy it is to introduce

## Variables ...

... that will help you store reusable CSS property values.

## Nesting ...

... that will help you organize your CSS selectors in a hierarchy resembling the HTML tree.

## Referencing Parent Selector ...

... that will allow you to reference the parent / nesting selector and reuse it inside your nested selectors.

## Namespaced Properties ...

... that will allow you to save typing for namespaced CSS properties, like `background-color`, `background-image`, e.t.c.
 
## Partials ...

... that will help you reuse and organize your CSS source files into smaller files.

## Mixins ...

... that will help you create function-like reusable blocks of CSS property value pairs.

## Extend/Inheritance ...

... that will help you reuse CSS rules and extend them with extra property value pairs to specialize them.

## Operators ...

... that will help you do simple maths inside your CSS and calculate values relative to the values of other properties.

Sass is a very powerful tool. It is heavily used in many Web Frameworks, including Ruby on Rails, which will be the
framework we will be teaching later on, in the back-end part of this course.
