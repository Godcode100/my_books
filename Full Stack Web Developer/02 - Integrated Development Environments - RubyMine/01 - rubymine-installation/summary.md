While a simple text editor does the job for simple one-file projects, you will need a powerful
Web development application that will allow you to develop complex projects with many files and
dependencies. The applications that help us create Web applications are called IDEs (Integrated 
Development Environments). 

One of the most popular IDEs is `RubyMine` (https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/). We will install RubyMine and prepare it for
further development.

> **Important :** Tech Career Booster students can get a 1-year free license for RubyMine. Please, contact Julia, your Tech
Career Booster Student Advisor in order to find out how you can obtain your 1-year free license. Until then, if you download RubyMine,
you can use it, free of charge, for 30-days.
