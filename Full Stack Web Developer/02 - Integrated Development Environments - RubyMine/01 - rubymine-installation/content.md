When your Web development projects become complex, including many files and sometimes long ones, you will need
the help of an IDE, a.k.a. an Integrated Development Environment. These specially designed applications help 
developers develop their projects in a much more productive mode, if compared to simple editors. They are called
Integrated, because they integrate, seamlessly, under one application, all the necessary tools for the Web developer
to do its job with much ease.

In this course, and because of the fact that the core programming language that we will use is `Ruby`, we have decided
to use [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/), which is an awesome IDE for doing Web Development. Not only does it support the core `Ruby` language,
but on top of that, it supports HTML, CSS and other Web development tools, both on the front-end (e.g. `JavaScript`) and 
on the back-end (e.g. `Ruby on Rails`).

In this chapter, we will install RubyMine. In the next chapter we will see some of the features that this IDE offers and that
you need to be familiar with in order to increase your productivity. 

> **Important :** Tech Career Booster students can get a 1-year free license for RubyMine. Please, contact Julia, your Tech
Career Booster Student Advisor in order to find out how you can obtain your 1-year free license. Until then, if you download RubyMine,
you can use it, free of charge, for 30-days.

## Installation

Before you actually install RubyMine, you need to make sure that you have `Ruby` installed on your machine. 

Check that you have installed `Ruby` on your machine with the following command on your command prompt:

``` bash
ruby --version
```

If this command returns the version of your ruby, you will see something like this:

```
ruby 2.2.3p173 (2015-08-18 revision 51636) [x86_64-darwin14]
```

Otherwise, you will see something like this, which indicates the error that `Ruby` has not been found and, probably, it is not installed on your computer:

```
-bash: ruby: command not found
```

Then, download and install RubyMine from the relevant-to-your-operating system download page:

> *Note* that you need to either pick `OS X` or `Linux`. As we have said earlier, this course is not supported on Windows development environment.
