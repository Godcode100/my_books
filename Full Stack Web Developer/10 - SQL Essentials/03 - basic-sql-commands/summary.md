This chapter is good introduction to basic SQL commands. You are going to start creating a database such as this:

![./images/Primitive CRM - The ERD](./images/primitive-customer-relationship-management-system-erd.png)
 
After a recap on the entities between tables, you will learn all the necessary commands to create the database `customers_db` and its
first table `customers`. Then you will manage (create, retrieve, update, delete) the data stored inside this table.

So, this chapter is an introduction to both DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language).
