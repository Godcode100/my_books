# Task B

## B. Make sure that your student creates a database and a table according to the following:

1. Table belongs to the database `school_db`. You have to create this database.
2. Name of the table is `students`.
3. Table has the following columns:
    1. column `id` which is an integer with display length 11. It should not be taking null values and it should be incremented. 
    2. column `first_name` which is a string with maximum 50 characters. It should not be taking null values.
    3. column `last_name` which is a string with maximum 100 characters. It should not be taking null values.
4. Then insert the following data:
```
+------------+-----------+    
| first_name | last_name |
| John       | Smith     |
| Mary       | Foo       |
| Paul       | Woo       |
+------------+-----------+
```

**Important**: Your student needs to upload their work (all SQL statements) on their Github account. You need to review it online.
