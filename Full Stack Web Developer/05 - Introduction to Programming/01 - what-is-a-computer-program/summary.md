In this chapter you will get a first glimpse on what a computer program might be.
Starting from the very basics, like the CPU and RAM:

and talking about registers.

A first encounter with the RAM structure and how content is stored inside it.

Then we will have a very basic introduction on Numbering Systems.

We will learn about the Assembly language and compare it to the High Level Programming Languages.

Finally, we will see the differences between Statically Typed Compiled Languages and Dynamically Typed Script Languages.
