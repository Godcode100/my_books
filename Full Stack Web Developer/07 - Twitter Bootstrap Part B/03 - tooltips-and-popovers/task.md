1. You need to develop a web page that demonstrates both the tooltips and the popovers.
2. Try to create a page like this (for this page, the whole content has been taken from Wikipedia).
![./images/Task Page With Tooltips and Popovers](./images/task-page-with-tooltips-and-popovers.jpg)
3. You can watch this page in action here too:
<div id="media-title-video-task-tooltips-and-popovers.mp4">Task - Sample Page with Tooltips and Popovers</div>
<a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/194368287"></a>          

**Important**: Your code needs to be uploaded into a new project on your Github account. Invite your mentor to review your code online.
