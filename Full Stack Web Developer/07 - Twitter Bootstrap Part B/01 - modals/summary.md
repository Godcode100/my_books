In this chapter we start to apply our JavaScript knowledge to Twitter Bootstrap. You will see how
Bootstrap provides very useful JavaScript libraries to help us add dynamic behaviour to our Web application,
with as little effort as possible.

We start with modals, which are dialog windows that try to attract user's attention and focus. Like this one:

![./images/Modal Example](./images/modal-example.jpg)

Then we explain how you integrate Twitter Bootstrap JavaScript libraries with your own HTML page.

We learn about the modal HTML markup and its main parts:

Then we learn how to create impressive modals with pictures:

Finally, we learn all about events related to modals and you are asked to build a modal that handles related events:
