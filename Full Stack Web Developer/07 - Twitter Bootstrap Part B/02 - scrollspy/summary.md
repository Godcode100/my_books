Long-content pages usually have top navigation bars that allow the user to quickly navigate to
sections within the page. This feature is accompanied by the fact that the menu item highlighted
as active, is automatically updated/changed according to the visible section of the page.

<div id="media-title-video-scroll-spy-in-action.mp4">Scroll Spy in Action</div>
<a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/194359519"></a>
