1. You need to implement a page what contains an image roster.
2. You need to use Twitter Bootstrap tools to make it responsive.
3. Here it is how the page should look like on large displays (>= 1200px):  

 <div>
  <figure>
    <img src="http://tech-career-booster-courses.s3.amazonaws.com/01-full-stack-web-developer/sections/04-twitter-bootstrap-part-a/chapters/01-getting-started/assets/images/task-responsive-image-roster.jpg"
        alt="Responsive Image Roster" title="Responsive Image Roster" style="border:1px solid gray; margin: 10px 5px;"></img>
    <div>Responsive Image Roster</div>
  </figure>
 </div>
 
As you can see, it has 6 images evenly positioned on the page.

4. The page should look like the following on small (>=768px) and medium (./images/./images/./images/<1200px) devices:

 <div>
  <figure>
    <img src="http://tech-career-booster-courses.s3.amazonaws.com/01-full-stack-web-developer/sections/04-twitter-bootstrap-part-a/chapters/01-getting-started/assets/images/responsive-image-on-small-and-medium-devices.jpg"
        alt="Responsive Image Roster On Small And Medium Devices" title="Responsive Image Roster On Small And Medium Devices" style="border:1px solid gray; margin: 10px 5px;"></img>
    <div>Responsive Image Roster On Small And Medium Devices</div>
  </figure>
 </div>
 
As you can see above, now, the images are arranged so that each row has 3 images, so all the images are displayed on 2 rows.

5. The page should look like the following on extra small devices (./images/./images/./images/<768px).

 <div>
  <figure>
    <img src="http://tech-career-booster-courses.s3.amazonaws.com/01-full-stack-web-developer/sections/04-twitter-bootstrap-part-a/chapters/01-getting-started/assets/images/responsive-image-on-extra-small-devices.jpg"
        alt="Responsive Image Roster On Extra Small Devices" title="Responsive Image Roster On Extra Small Devices" style="border:1px solid gray; margin: 10px 5px;"></img>
    <div>Responsive Image Roster On Extra Small Devices</div>
  </figure>
 </div>
 
As you can see above, now each image is displayed on its own row.

6. The header is an `h1` element.
7. The footer is an `h6` element.
8. The `img` tags should be styled with `width` and `height` 100% so that they occupy all the space they are given.
9. Upload your work to your Netlify account and browse your live page using your mobile and your tablet. Does it look as expected?

**Important**: Your code needs to be uploaded into a new project on your Github account. Invite your mentor to review your code online.
