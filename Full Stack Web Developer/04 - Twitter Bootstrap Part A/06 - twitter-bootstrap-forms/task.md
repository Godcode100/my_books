(1) You need to create one Twitter Bootstrap page with 3 forms on it

(2) One form needs to be a sign in form like this:

![./images/Task Form 1: Sign In Form](./images/task-sign-in-form.jpg)

(3) This is a basic Twitter Bootstrap form. The only difficulty that you may have is the symbol in the password input group. In order to achive that we are using the glyphicons. 
The glyphicons are symbols that can be drawn if one applied the correct glyphicon class on a span. For example, the following code:

``` html
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>
```
    
will display an image of a star:

![./images/Star Glyphicon](./images/glyphicon-star.jpg)

You can see the whole list of [glyphicons here](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons). Pick up the one that corresponds to the required by the task.<br/>

(4) Your page needs to be followed by a Sign Up form like the following:

![Task Form 2: Sign Up Form](./images/sign-up-form.jpg)<br/>

(5) Nothing is new here. Make sure that you use the correct glyphicons.

(6) Pay attention that the input controls are large input contorls.
 
(7) The third form is the same as the previous one, but all the input fields have been marked with contextual color. Everything has a success color, except one that has an error color:

![Task Form 3: Sign Up Form With an Error](./images/sign-up-form-with-an-error.jpg)<br/>

(8) Note that all the fields are populated with a value. You need to do that too (Hint: set the `value` attribute on the corresponding HTML elements).

(9) The whole page should be working like this:

<div id="media-title-video-task-forms.mp4">Task - Forms In Action</div>
<a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/194259728"></a>
                      
**Important**: Your code needs to be uploaded into a new project on your Github account. Invite your mentor to review your code online.
