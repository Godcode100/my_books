We have already learned in HTML & CSS section about the HTML forms and each one of the form controls.
Twitter Bootstrap gives us some extra tools in our hands, in the form of classes, that will allow us to style our
forms very easily.

You will be able to build a basic form like this:

![./images/Sign In Form](./images/task-sign-in-form.jpg)

or a form like this:

![./images/Sign Up Form](./images/sign-up-form.jpg)

You will also be able to display, very intuitively, which fields have been filled in successfully and which one not:

![./images/./images/Sign Up Form With an Error](./images/sign-up-form-with-an-error.jpg)
