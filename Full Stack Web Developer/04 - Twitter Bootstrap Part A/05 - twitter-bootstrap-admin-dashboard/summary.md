In this chapter we will work to build a Twitter Bootstrap Admin Dashboard. Like this:

![./images/Basic Admin Dashboard](./images/basic-admin-dashboard.jpg)

A site like the above, has the sidebar on a fixed position. The sidebar disappears on extra small devices and the dashboard changes its layout according to 
the device display width.

Also, the table is responsive and can be displayed equally well on both large and small displays.

You will also learn various other new concepts like how to display an image in a circle shape. Or how to alter the text color using
text color specific classes.

Have a look on the site that we will build:

<div id="media-title-video-admin-dashboard-demo-video.mp4-Admin Dashboard Site In Action">Admin Dashboard Site In Action</div>
