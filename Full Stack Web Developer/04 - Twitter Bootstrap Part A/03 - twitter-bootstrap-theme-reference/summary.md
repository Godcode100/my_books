We have created a small Twitter Bootstrap project in the previous chapter. Now, we are going to create a page
that would reference some of the most commonly used Twitter Bootstrap components. 
 
You will learn how to create drop down menus in the navigation bar:

At the end, you will be asked to create a page that would require you to use most of the above:
