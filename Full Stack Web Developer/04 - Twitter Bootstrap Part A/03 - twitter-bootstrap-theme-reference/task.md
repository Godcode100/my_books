1. You need to create a Web page like this:

 ![Task - Page With Twitter Elements" style="border:1px solid gray; margin: 10px 5px;](./images/task-twitter-bootstrap-elements.jpg)
 
2. It's a page with the following elements:
 
 ![Task - Page Elements" style="border:1px solid gray; margin: 10px 5px;](./images/task-twitter-bootstrap-elements-highlighted.jpg)
 
3. You can also see how one can scroll from top to bottom of this page like this:

 <div id="media-container-video-Task - Page With Various Twitter Bootstrap Elements">
  <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/194260210"></a>           
 </div>
  
4. Things that you need to take into consideration:
    1. The navigation bar does not occupy the whole width. It is 80% of its parent width.
    2. The navigation bar is in the center. Hint: Use margin-left and margin-right with value auto.
    3. The navigation bar has some free space on top of it.
    4. The navigation bar has rounded corners border.
    5. The carousel should have 4 items.
    6. There is a margin between the bottom of the carousel and the area with circle images and centered info.
    7. The images are circle shaped. Use the class "img-circle" to achieve this effect. Also, specify their width x height to be 140 x 140.
    8. For extra small, small and medium device width, we want to have 1 image & information block. For large display devices, we have 2.
    9. The buttons `View Details` are not actually `button` elements. They are anchors `a` that have the button classes applied. We prefer to use `a` instead of `button`,
    even if we style them as buttons, when the click works as a fetch to another page or brings some info to be displayed form the server. On the other hand we
    prefer to use `button` elements when we submit data to server, like in forms.

**Important**: Your code needs to be uploaded into a new project on your Github account. Invite your mentor to review your code online.
