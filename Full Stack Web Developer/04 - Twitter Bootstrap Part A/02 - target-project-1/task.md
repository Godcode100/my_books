2. Watch out the followings:
    1. The main content should be centered.
    2. There is a lot of blank space above the main content and below the navigation bar. Make sure that you have the same on your page.
    3. The navigation bar should be responsive and when you load your page on small displays the menu items should be hidden. In their place, a hamburger icon
    should be displayed. The icon, when clicked, will unfold the list with the menu options.
3. After finish, upload your work on Github and Netlify.
    
**Important**: Your code needs to be uploaded into a new project on your Github account. Invite your mentor to review your code online.
