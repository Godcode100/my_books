In the previous chapter we have learned about the Twitter Bootstrap grid system. In this chapter we develop a Web page
that has a navigation bar fixed at the top. Like this:

![./images/Basic Template With Top Nav Bar](./images/responsive-starter-with-menu.jpg)

This navigation bar is responsive, which means, it can be equally displayed on small display devices. In those cases, the menu is hidden behind a 
hamburger icon:

![./images/This is How Site Looks Like On Mobile Devices](./images/web-site-nav-bar-collapsed-to-hamburger-icon.jpg)

When the user clicks on the hamburger icon, the menu is unfolded, like this:

![./images/Menu Options Appear on Hamburger Icon Click](./images/menu-options-are-hidden-behind-the-hamburger-icon.jpg)

You will develop this Web page, but at the same time, you will understand how the Twitter Bootstrap classes work.
Finally, you will upload this page on your Netlify account, live for anybody to see, either on a desktop display or on a mobile one.
