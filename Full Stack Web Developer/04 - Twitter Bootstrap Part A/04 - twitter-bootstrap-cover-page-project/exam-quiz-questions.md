### Question #1 - How do we reduce the brightness of the background image of our Web page?

*Choose Only One*

1. You can change the background color of the `body` element to have opacity 0.3.
2. You can create an empty `div` with background color black, opacity 0.5 and z index -1.
3. You can create a div with another background image that is transparent but with background color black with opacity 0.5.
4. You can create an empty `div` that would be absolutely positioned at (0, 0) and with 100% width and height. You also make it have black color with opacity 0.5 and z index -1.
