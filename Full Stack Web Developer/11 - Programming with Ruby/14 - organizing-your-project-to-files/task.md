# Task B.

You need to write a program `calculator.rb` which will be asking the user for 2 integer numbers and the mathematics
operator to apply to them. Then it will be returning the result of the operation. The operations supported should be
the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Make sure that your program is using at least one function that
is defined in its own file and that the `calculator.rb` refers to it. The user will be able to terminate the program
by giving an empty response on the question about the operation.

Here is an example run of the program:

``` bash
$ ruby calculator.rb
Give me first number: 5
Give me second number: 4
Give me the arithmetic operator (+-*/): +
The result of the operation is: 9
Give me first number: 3
Give me second number: 3
Give me the arithmetic operator (+-*/): 
$
```

**Important**: Your code needs to be uploaded into a new project on your Github account. Invite your mentor to review your code online.
