# Task B

## Write a program that asks the user for 2 numbers and then it prints the maximum of the two. Here is an example run of this program:
``` bash
$ ruby maximum_number.rb
Please, give the first number: 80
Please, give the second number: 90
Maximum number is: 90
$
```

**Important**: Your code needs to be uploaded into a new project on your Github account. Invite your mentor to review your code online.

# Task C

## Write a program that asks the user a number. Then it prints whether the number is odd or even. Here is an example run of this program:

``` bash
$ ruby odd_vs_even.rb
Please, give me the integer number (greater than or equal to 0): 11
This number is odd
$
```

Note that this program should check whether the number given is in the correct range. If not, it should print corresponding message. Only 
numbers greater than or equal to 0 should be allowed.
For example:

``` bash
$ ruby odd_vs_even.rb
Please, give me the integer number (greater than or equal to 0): -12
You didn't give a valid number
$
```
