There is not any particular task for this chapter. We believe that this chapter should be actually practiced against your Ruby program tasks,
on other chapters. However:

**IMPORTANT** Let your mentor know that you have studied this chapter and send him an overview about your understanding on
debugging, both for prompt-like debugging and RubyMine debugging. Your mentor will discuss with you any questions or problems
that you may have with regards to using debuggers.
