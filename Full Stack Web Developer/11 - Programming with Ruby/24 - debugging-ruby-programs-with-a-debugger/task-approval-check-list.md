There is no task for this chapter. However your student needs to send you their understanding on
debugging Ruby programs using both prompt-like debugging and RubyMine debugging. You need to discuss with them
in order to make sure that they understand how to debug Ruby programs. Solve any problem and answer any question 
that your student might have with regards to debuggers.
