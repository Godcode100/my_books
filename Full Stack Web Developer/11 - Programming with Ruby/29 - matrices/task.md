You need to create a Ruby program that asks the user to give a square matrix. The program is able to 
calculate the inverse and the determinant of that matrix. Here is a sample run of this program:

<div id="media-container-video-Square Matrix Inverse and Determinant">
  <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/200136494"></a>
</div>

Here are some instructions and hints:

1. Inverse and Determinant are only calculated for square matrices. Hence, program needs to ask only one number for the dimenstions
of the matrix to work with.
2. Make sure you don't have repeated code. Or at least limit repeated code to as few as possible. Your code needs to be DRY.
3. Remember that matrices are immutable objects and you might want to use an `Array` to get the element values first, before
converting it a `Matrix` and calculating inverse and determinant.

**Important:** You will need to upload your work to your Github account. Your mentor will evaluate that online.
