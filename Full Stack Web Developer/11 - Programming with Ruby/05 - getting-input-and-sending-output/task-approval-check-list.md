# Task B

Your student needs to write a program in Ruby that will ask the user 2 questions. 1) What is their first name and 2) What is
their last name. Then, it will print a greeting message that will include both first and last name.

Here is a sample implementation:

``` ruby
print 'Please, give me your first name: '
first_name = gets
print 'Please, give me your last name: '
last_name = gets
puts "Hello #{first_name} #{last_name}"
```
