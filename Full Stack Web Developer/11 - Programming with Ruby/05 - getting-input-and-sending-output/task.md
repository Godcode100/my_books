# Task B

Please, write a program in Ruby that will ask the user 2 questions. 1) What is their first name and 2) What is
their last name. Then, it will print a greeting message that will include both first and last name.

The following video demonstrates how the program (called `task.rb`) should behave. 

> *Note:* there is a glitch on this program, obvious when the greeting message is printed. But we will learn how to fix this bug in later chapters.
