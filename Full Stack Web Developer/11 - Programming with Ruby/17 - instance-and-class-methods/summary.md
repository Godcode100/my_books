This chapter explains the differences between instance and class methods, between instance and class attributes too. It is very fundamental
and important to understand the differences between these two concepts. It will help you better grasp the idea of how classes and objects
are placed in memory one against the other.

Other important object related information will be presented too. For example, information about `self` and `main`.
