A. You need to implement the class `Acme::Queue`. The `Acme` is a module and `Queue` is the class. The need for the module
is in order to prevent name clashes with internal Ruby `Queue` classes. Your Queue needs to implement that methods that are
described in the `Queue` paragraph of the chapter content. You also need to create a `main.rb` file that would demonstrate
the use of your `Queue`.

B. You need to implement a queue that would not allow to add the same item twice. Take for example that your items are Students
with first name and last name. Consider that two student instances are the same if they have the same first name and last name.
