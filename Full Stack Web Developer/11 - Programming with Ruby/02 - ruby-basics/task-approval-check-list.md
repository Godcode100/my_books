# Task B. Ruby Program

Your student needs to write a Ruby program that would print the result of the formula:

![./images/Task Formula](./images/formula.jpg)
           
A sample implementation is given here:

``` ruby
a = 5
x = 2
b = 10
c = 3
result = a * x ** 2 + b * x + c
puts result
```

**Important** Make sure your student uploads their work on their Github account. You need to review their work online.
