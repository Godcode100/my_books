# Task B

Write a program:
1. defines a function, named `print_reverse_keys_with_values`.
2. the function takes as argument a hash.
3. function reverses the keys with values and prints the new hash.
4. note that the function does not alter the original hash.

Hence, assuming that the hash is `{a: 1, b: 2}`, then, when calling the function, it should
print `{1=>:a, 2=>:b}`. 

**Important:** Do not use the `Hash#invert()` method. This is an exercise for you to increase your skills in using Hashes and understand their structure.

**Important**: Your code needs to be uploaded into a new project on your Github account. Invite your mentor to review your code online.
