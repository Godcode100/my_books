![./images/Linked List Example](./images/linked-in-example.png)

This chapter is an exercise that describes how one could implement a simply linked list of items. It is used as an introduction to
data structures. Although Ruby offers classes such as `Array`, taking this exercise is very useful because it will also
ask you to deal with Ruby collections, Enumerables and Enumerators. The task will ask you to implement your own data structure.
