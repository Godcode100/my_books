# Task B

You need to design a class `Traveller` that will have the following three properties:

1. First Name
2. Last Name
3. Passport Number

Make sure that

* Two instances of that class with same attributes are considered equal.
* The instances of this class can be used as hash keys.
* The instances of this class can be sorted in alphabetical order, first by last name, then by
first name and then by passport number.

Write also a program that demonstrates that your class has been designed correctly.
