Nintendo shares have tumbled after investors gave the thumbs down to its new Super Mario app.

The Japanese technology giant saw $2bn (Â£1.6bn) wiped off its market value as shares fell by 5%
in Tokyo, after Super Mario Run was made available on the iPhone in 151 countries.

It later recovered slightly to close 4% lower.

Super Mario's release is the latest foray by Nintendo into the mobile app market after the Pokemon
GO craze earlier this year.

Early signs for the Mario game were positive as it topped download rankings in Britain, Japan, Germany
and Australia.
