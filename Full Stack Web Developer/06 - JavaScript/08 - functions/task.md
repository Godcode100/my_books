(1) Write a function and a program that would demonstrate its use. This function should take as input a temperature in Fahrenheit and would return it in Celsius.
Make also sure that you are using the `Math.round()` function to round the result to an integer number.

(2) Write the factorial function and a program that demonstrates its use. Do not use recursive method. If you do not know what a factorial function is ... google for it.

(4) Write a program in which an object, `employee`, has 3 properties:

1. A `name`. This is the name of the employee.
2. A `salary`. This is the salary of the employee.
3. A `numberOfYears`. This is the number of years the employee is in the company.
    
Then make sure that this object has a method that would return the bonus this employee would deserve according to the following logic:

1. If the employee is more than 10 years in the company, then bonus would be 2 times its salary.
2. If the employee is up to 10 years in company, including, then bonus would be 1 times its salary.
3. If the employee is up to 5 years in the company, including, then bonus would be half its salary.
4. If the employee is less than 6 months in the company, wouldn't deserve a bonus.
    
Demonstrate that the implementation of your method is correct, by printing the bonus for various example employees.

(5) Write a function that takes a string and returns back the string with its first character uppercase. Call that method with various examples
to demonstrate that it works. Note that if the function is called without arguments or it is called with a blank string argument, it should return
a blank string.

**Important**: Your code needs to be uploaded into a new project on your Github account. Invite your mentor to review your code online.

(6) Write a function that takes an arbitrary number of arguments, all strings, and returns one string being the concatenation of all
strings given as arguments. The concatenation needs to join the strings using a blank space. Also, make sure that the first character
of each individual string appears uppercase on final concatenated string. This is an example of calling this method and the 
result that it returns:
``` javascript      
var result = concatenateAndUppercase("foo", "bar", "mary", "woo");
console.log(result); // prints "Foo Bar Mary Woo"
```
Note that function should return an empty string if no arguments are given. And it should handle arguments that are blank strings too (by ignoring them).
Hint: You may want to reuse the function that you have developed on previous program (5).
