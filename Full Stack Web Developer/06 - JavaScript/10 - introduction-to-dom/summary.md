This chapter is an introduction to DOM, the document object model. It is very important to have 
a first understanding of how the DOM is built according to the HTML content.

Then, we are going to learn the necessary JavaScript code that will allow us to locate HTML elements of the document.
Locating the elements will have the chance to dynamically alter the HTML content. This is how we leave the
static aspect of our Web page and we add dynamics to the Web page that would make it more attractive for the
users to use.

Note that the techniques that we learn here are very basic. We will not delve into advanced DOM manipulation techniques.
Advanced DOM manipulation will be covered later on in the jQuery chapters.
