(1) You need to create an HTML page that has two buttons. Button 1 and Button 2. Whenever user clicks on Button 1,
then Button 1 becomes a big button. Whenever user clicks on Button 2, then Button 2 becomes the big button.
Watch the following video in order to understand what the page should look like and how the button should be
responding to events:

<div id="media-title-video-task-event-handling-buttons.mp4">Task For Event Handling - Buttons</div>
<a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/194307666"></a>
           
As you can see, the buttons, initially have same width. It is `110px` wide. When they go large, their width is `300px`.

> Hint: When you want to change the width of an element using JavaScript, you can set a value to `style` property of the element. The
value can be any valid style property value. For example: "width: 300px;".
   
**Important**: Your code needs to be uploaded into a new project on your Github account. Invite your mentor to review your code online.
   
(2) Task with 'blur' and 'focus' events. You need to create a page in which there are two text input fields and a button. 
When the user clicks on any input in order to start typing a value, then the border of that input should become blue. When
the user leaves an input to either go to the other input or to the button, the input border should become either red or green.
It becomes red if the user has not given any value. It becomes green if the user has given some value. Watch the following 
video in order to understand what we mean.

<div id="media-title-video-task-2-event-handling-focus-blur.mp4">Task 2 - Demo</div>
<a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/194307490"></a>           

Here are some hints:

1. The event that is triggered when user clicks on an input control is the `focus` event.
2. The event that is triggered when user leaves an input control to move out of it, it is called `blur` event.
3. To set the border of the input control, just set a value to its `style` property, like `input.style = "border: 1px solid red;";`.
