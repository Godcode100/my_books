This is where we start learning real programming, using JavaScript.

It's a short but useful chapter because it will teach you the basics of the
JavaScript syntax.

The case sensitivity of the language. For example:

Is this one
```
customer
```
same as this one
```
Customer
```
?

Then you will learn how you can write comments inside your code.

After that, you will learn what a literal is.

Also, you will learn how to name variables and functions. The identifiers vs
the Reserved Words.

Finally, you will learn how you should be terminating your JavaScript statements.
