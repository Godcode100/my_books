(1) Write a program that sorts an array in case insensitive alphabetical order.

**Important**: Your code needs to be uploaded into a new project on your Github account. Invite your mentor to review your code online.

(2) Write a program that demonstrates the matrix addition. Assume that you have
two 2-dimensional matrices, 4 x 4. Read about [matrix addition here](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/mtrxadd.htm).
Here are some hints to help you write this program:

1. Declare a variable `A` to be an array of arrays. Declare all the values of all the elements. An array literal. 
2. Declare a variable `B` in a similar way.
3. Declare a variable `C` to be an empty array.
4. In order to access the element on row 2 and column 3 on table `A`, you write something like `A[1][2]`. 
5. You will need a double nested loop construct, i.e. a `for` inside a `for`. The external `for` goes from
one row to the next. The internal `for` goes from one column to the next.
6. Before starting the column internal `for` loop, you will need to initially the corresponding `C` row to
and empty array `[]`.

(3) Given the array `[5, 8, 2, 15, 32, 3, 46]` calculate the sum of the array converted elements, when conversion
is according to the formula `element * 2 + 15`. In other words, write a JavaScript program that calculates the sum
of `5 * 2 + 15, 8 * 2 + 15, 2 * 2 + 15, ..., 46 * 2 + 15`. Create 2 versions of the program. One that is using
`map()` and `reduce()`. And another one that does not use these two methods.
