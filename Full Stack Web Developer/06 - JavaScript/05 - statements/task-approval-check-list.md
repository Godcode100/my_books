Your student needs to implement the programs required by the task of the chapter. 

Here are sample implementations:

### Program 1:

``` javascript
var a = 5, b = 3, c = 2;
var maximum = a;

if (b > maximum) {
    maximum = b;
}

if (c > maximum) {
    maximum = c;
}

console.log(maximum);
```

**Important**: Your student needs to upload their work on their Github account. You need to review it online.

### Program 2:

``` javascript
var today = 2;

switch(today) {
    case 1:
        console.log("Sunday");
        break;
    case 2:
        console.log("Monday");
        break;
    case 3:
        console.log("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 4:
        console.log("Wednesday");
        break;
    case 5:
        console.log("Thursday");
        break;
    case 6:
        console.log("Friday");
        break;
    case 7:
        console.log("Saturday");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Invalid Date Number");
        break;
}
```

**Important**: Your student needs to upload their work on their Github account. You need to review it online.

### Program 3

``` javascript
for (var i = 1; i <= 51; i++) {
    if (i === 13 || i === 23 || i === 45) {
        continue;
    }
    if (i % 2 === 1) {
        console.log(i);
    }
}
```
