(1) You need to write a JavaScript program that finds the maximum number among three numbers. Here is the start of it:
``` javascript
var a = 5, b = 3, c = 2;
....
```
You need to fill in the rest of the program that would print the maximum number among the tree stored in `a`, `b` or `c`.
Hint: Use `if` statements.

**Important**: Your code needs to be uploaded into a new project on your Github account. Invite your mentor to review your code online.

(2) You need to write a JavaScript program that converts an integer number to the week day name. Here is the start of it:
``` javascript
var today = 2;
...
```
Depending on the value of `today` it needs to print the name of the weekday. Hence, for `1`, it should print `Sunday`,
for `2`, it should print `Monday` and so on. If the number stored in `today` is not in the range `1-7`, then it should
print the message `"Invalid Date"`.
Hint: Use `switch` statement.

**Important**: Your code needs to be uploaded into a new project on your Github account. Invite your mentor to review your code online.

(3) You need to write a JavaScript program that prints all the odd numbers starting from 1 up to 51. Note that it should
skip the numbers 13, 23 and 45.

**Important**: Your code needs to be uploaded into a new project on your Github account. Invite your mentor to review your code online.
