(1) You need to write a small JavaScript program that demonstrates how we can swap the values of two variables.

1. declares a variable `a` with value `5`.
2. declares a variable `b` with value `10`.
3. prints the contents of the two variables using `console.log()` statements. This one prints `5` and then `10`
4. swaps the values of these two variables.
5. prints the contents of the two variables using `console.log()` statements. This one prints `10` and then `5`.

**Important**: Your code needs to be uploaded into a new project on your Github account. Invite your mentor to review your code online.

(2) You need to write a small JavaScript program that demonstrates the truth of the mathematical formula:

<div>
(a + b)(a - b) = a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup>
</div>
Hints:

1. You can do that by assuming that `a` has the value `5` and `b` has the value `10`. 
2. Use as many temporary variables that you want in order to progressively calculate the left part of the equation.
3. Same for right part of the equation.
4. Then print the result of comparing the outputs of the previous 2 steps using the comparison operator. It should print `true`.
