Make sure that the student implements the two programs requested. For your convenience here are sample implementations.

(1) Program 1:
``` javascript
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);

var z;
z = a;
a = b;
b = z;

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
```
**Important**: Your student needs to upload their work on their Github account. You need to review it online.

(2) Program 2:
``` 
var a = 5;
var b = 6;
var c = a + b;
var d = a - b;
var e = c * d;
var f = a * a - b * b;
console.log(e == f);
```
