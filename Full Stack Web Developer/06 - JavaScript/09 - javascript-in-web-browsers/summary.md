The previous chapters on JavaScript were about some of the core features of the language. Now we start the real fun, because 
we are going to see how JavaScript is used by the browsers. This is what we call client-side JavaScript.

You will start executing JavaScript code from within an HTML page. We are going to have fun with 
timers and scheduling actions to be executed in the future, either once, or periodically.

You are going to learn how you can change the page loaded dynamically.

For example, this is one thing that you will learn to do. On this example, the date and time
are dynamically updated every 1 second:

<div id="media-title-video-updating-date-and-time-dynamically-with-set-interval.mp4">Date And Time Automatically Updated</div>
<a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/194309687"></a>
           
You will also learn how to present information to user and get some back from him.
           
<div id="media-title-video-using-dialog-methods.mp4">Using Dialog Methods</div>
<a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/194309773"></a>
          
Finally, you will learn how to open and close windows and tabs dynamically.

<div id="media-title-video-opening-and-closing-a-window.mp4">Opening and Closing a Window</div>
<a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/194306543"></a>
