This chapter introduces you to HTTP, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the protocol that Web browsers are using to communicated with Web
servers. It is the fundamental stone to your journey to Web development. In other words, you cannot claim to be a Web developer if you don't
grasp, at least, the basics of HTTP. Also, this chapter is necessary for you to easier understand the next chapters and sections that follow
on Web development.
