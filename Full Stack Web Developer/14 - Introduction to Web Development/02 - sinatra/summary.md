Sinatra is a very famous Ruby Web framework that relies on Rack. In this chapter we are going to explain to you how you can write your
first Web application! Not only that, we are going to tell you how to deploy that into a production Web applications hosting server.
You will really enjoy this chapter being the first that allows you to process the data that you collect using HTML forms.
And it is a great foundation chapter for the next big section on Ruby on Rails.
