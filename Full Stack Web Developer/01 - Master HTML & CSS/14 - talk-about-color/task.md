1. Create the following page using a table and cells.

 <div id="media-container-image-Table with color cells">
  <div id="media-title-image-Table with color cells">Table with color cells</div>
  <img src="./images/playing-with-colors-to-color-table-cells-hex-numbers-and-rgb-2.jpg"
      alt="Table with color cells" title="Table with color cells" style="border:1px solid gray; margin: 10px 5px;"></img>
 </div>
 
2. In order to color the text of the first column you should use the name value for the color.
3. In order to color the text of the second column you should use the hex value of the color.
4. In order to color the text of the third column you should use the rgb value of the color.
5. Use any method you want to correctly color the background of the fourth column.
6. The last row, first three columns, have a background color that make the Beige color appear more clearly. Pick up any background color that you want for these three columns. We are using `darkblue` here.
7. For this exercise only, you should not use a separate CSS file. You have to use the `style` attribute.
