1. Implement the following page:

 <div>
  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tech-career-booster-courses/01-full-stack-web-developer/sections/01-html-and-css/chapters/18-diving-page-to-sections-using-divs/assets/images/dividing-page-with-divs-task.png"
      alt="Dividing Page with Divs - Task" title="Dividing Page with Divs - Task" style="border:1px solid gray; margin: 10px 5px;"></img>
 </div>
 
2. You need to make sure that:
    1. You have `border-box` sizing for elements.
    2. You are using as little CSS repetition code as possible.
    3. Use different background colors and text colors for each section it order to make it stand out from the others.
