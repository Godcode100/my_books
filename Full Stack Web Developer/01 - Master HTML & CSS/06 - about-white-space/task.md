1. Create an HTML document that, when displayed using the browser, would look like that:

 <div id="media-container-image-Letter to Mary">
   <div id="media-title-image-Letter to Mary">Letter to Mary</div>
   <img src="./images/letter-to-mary.png"
      alt="Letter to Mary" title="Letter to Mary" style="border:1px solid gray; margin: 10px 5px;"></img>
 </div>
Note that this needs to be displayed exactly as depicted. In other words, the text should be broken into multiple lines
as on the picture.
 
2. Send the HTML document to your mentor for review.
