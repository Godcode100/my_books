In this chapter we explain what does white space mean for a browser. For example, how do we
create an HTML page with content like the following:

<div id="media-container-image-Line breaks and Multiple White Spaces">
    <div id="media-title-image-Line breaks and Multiple White Spaces">Line breaks and Multiple White Spaces</div>
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tech-career-booster-courses/01-full-stack-web-developer/sections/01-html-and-css/chapters/06-about-white-space/assets/images/three-lines-one-below-the-other-with-many-blank-spaces.png"
          alt="Line breaks and Multiple White Spaces" title="Line breaks and Multiple White Spaces" style="border:1px solid gray; margin: 10px 5px;"></img>
    <div>Web Page Explaining the White Space</div>
</div>

or the following:

<div id="media-container-image-Lines and One Blank Line in Between">
    <div id="media-title-image-Lines and One Blank Line in Between">Lines and One Blank Line in Between</div>
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tech-career-booster-courses/01-full-stack-web-developer/sections/01-html-and-css/chapters/06-about-white-space/assets/images/lines-and-one-blank-line-in-between.png"
          alt="Lines and One Blank Line in Between" title="Lines and One Blank Line in Between" style="border:1px solid gray; margin: 10px 5px;"></img>
    <div>Empty lines</div>
</div>

Understanding how browsers deal with white space, blanks, new lines, e.t.c. is very important.
