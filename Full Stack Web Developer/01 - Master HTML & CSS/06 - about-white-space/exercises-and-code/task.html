    <h1>Letter to Mary</h1>

    Dear Mary<br>
    <br>
    I am writing to you to let you know that I will be visiting<br>
    your city next weekend.<br>
    <br>
    So, I was wondering whether you would like to have dinner with me.<br>
    We can discuss about the new project that I am working on and whether<br>
    you can offer to me some special price for Internet Marketing services<br>
    via your company. I know that you are marketing genius!<br>
    <br>
    Looking forward to it!<br>
