        <strong>Sarakiniko:</strong> Sarakiniko is a beach on Milos Island, Greece. It is situated on the north shore of the island. The waves from the northwind brings greyish -
        white rocks that can have amazing shapes often compared to a moonscapeTemplate:Asf. The local people often refer to the scenic landscape of
        Sarakiniko as Lunar[citation needed]. The bone white beach derives from its unusual characteristics from volcanic rocks shaped by wind and wave.
        Sarakiniko is the most photographed landscape in the Aegean.

      <p id="kleftiko">
        <strong>Kleftiko:</strong> Kleftiko or else “The Meteora Rocks of the Sea”, as it is usually called, constitutes a group of grey-white rocks of strange shapes and formations,
        with caves and cavities created by the wind and the sea in the passing of the centuries. In order to enjoy its crystal blue green waters and its unique
        formations you will have to approach by boat or by yacht. In old times Kleftiko was used as a refuge and a hide-out  for pirates and thus it was named after them.

      <p id="firiplaka">
        <strong>Firiplaka:</strong> The beach of Firiplaka is a fairly large beach, cut in half by a large rock (plate) which has been detached from the mountain.
        The first part of the beach is the one where you will find the beach bar and sunbeds, probably the second song on your own or with a camper company that has
        reached the other side of the beach.
        The beach has shallow but clear waters combined with white sand. It is best to avoid days with southerly winds.
        Before or after that you can also visit the beach of Tsigrado which is right next to that of Firiplaka.
