In this chapter we are going to learn how we can position our HTML elements on the canvas.
The elements are usually positioned using the normal page flow. However, we may be in the need
to position elements out of the normal flow, at specific positions within the browser window.

We build pages like these:

![./images/Page With Top and Bottom Nav Bar](./images/page-with-top-and-bottom-nav-bar.jpg)

![./images/Page Fixed Image On The Left](./images/page-with-fixed-image-on-the-left.jpg)

![./images/Page with Paragraphs First Char Stand Out](./images/page-with-paragraphs-and-first-letter-distinct.jpg)

![./images/Two Images With Tags](./images/page-with-absolute-positioned-elements.jpg)

![./images/Task for Positioning](./images/task-positioning.jpg)

We will also learn how to stack elements one on top of the other:

and about the stacking order used by the browser:
