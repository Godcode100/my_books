This chapter enters the interactive world of HTML. We will have an introduction on the `form` element and the most important
UI elements that are used to collect information from the user.

You will build pages like the following:

![./images/Simple Form for Collecting Address Details](./images/simple-form-for-collecting-address-details.jpg)

And not only that. We will spend some time tuning the input element properties. For example, we will add validations like this:

![./images/First Name is Flagged As Required](./images/required-field-needs-to-be-filled-out.jpg)

We will learn to use specific types of input elements, like emails and passwords. For example, in order to build a sign up form:

![./images/A Sign Up Form](./images/sign-up-form.jpg)

We will learn to use a series of checkboxes in order to let the user tell us which options would he prefer:

![./images/Multiple Checkboxes](./images/multiple-checkboxes.jpg)

We will also learn how we could select one or more options using multiple select boxes:

![./images/Multiple Select Box](./images/select-game-using-multi-select-box.jpg)

Next we will learn how we could select one option amongst many using radio buttons:

![./images/Specify Age Range Using Radio Buttons](./images/specify-age-range.jpg)

And we will learn how we can ask the user to enter a multi-line message like in a contact form:

![./images/Contact Us Form](./images/contact-us-form.jpg)

We will proceed in explaining other features of input elements too, like placeholders and titles, min and max attributes. We will use UI elements that visualize a range
of values, like in the following volume slider:

![./images/Form that is using range input](./images/from-with-input-of-type-range.jpg)

We will learn how we can group options in a drop down list:

![./images/Grouping Options in a Drop Down List](./images/grouping-options-in-a-drop-down-list.jpg)

We will learn how we can use a color picker to let user pick up a color:

![./images/User selects color from a color picker](./images/let-user-pick-up-a-color.jpg)

We will learn how we can use a date picker to let user pick up a date:

![./images/User picks up a date using a date picker](./images/let-user-pick-up-date.jpg)

We will learn how we can ask the user to upload a file, like in this example:

![./images/Form to Upload a File](./images/form-to-upload-a-file.jpg)

And we will finally learn how we can visually group form fields like in this example:

![./images/Checkout Form With Grouping of Fields](./images/checkout-with-fieldsets.jpg)

Your task, at the end of the chapter, will be to build a page with this form here:
