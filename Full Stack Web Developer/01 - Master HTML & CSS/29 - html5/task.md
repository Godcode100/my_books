        1. Needs to have all the fields required.
        2. The focus should be on the Name field when the page loads.
        3. The visible rows that user can type inside the message box should be 3.
    6. Be careful with the styling:
        1. `body` element needs to have enough top and bottom margins so that the content is not hidden.
        2. The button of the Contact us form, needs to have the font family "Droid Sans" like the rest of the document.
        3. Choose your own colors, but make sure that
            1. When the mouse moves over any of the menu items, top or bottom, the color changes.
            2. When the mouse moves over the "Send" button on Contact Us form the background color and color of the button change.
        4. You may need to increase the z-index of the top navigation bar. This is because the video player controls UI might be drawn on top of the navigation bar if not done.
4. You will need to upload your work to Netlify.
