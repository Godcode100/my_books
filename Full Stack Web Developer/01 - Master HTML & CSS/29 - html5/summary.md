HTML5 is now the standard that is supported by all the major browsers. However, HTML5 is a living standard
and new features are added quite often. In this chapter we are going to learn about the semantic elements
of HTML5, which we should be using in order to tell browser and other developers reading our code what
each area of our page is about.

We will implement a page like this:

![./images/Page that uses HTML5 Semantic Elements](./images/page-that-uses-html5-semantic-elements.jpg)

using HTML5 semantic elements.

Then we will talk about HTML5 Multimedia support. We will learn how we can embed video and audio resources inside our HTML pages.
You will be requested to build a page like this:

![./images/Task with Video and Audio Tags](./images/task-with-video-and-audio-tags.jpg)

Finally, we will see how we can embed YouTube videos inside our HTML pages:
