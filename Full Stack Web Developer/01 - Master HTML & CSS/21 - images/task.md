1. Add a copyright notice at the bottom of the site that we have built in this chapter. This should be the final result
(Use your own name instead of "Tech Career Booster"):

 <div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tech-career-booster-courses/01-full-stack-web-developer/sections/01-html-and-css/chapters/21-images/assets/images/page-with-lion-with-copyright-notice.png"
        alt="Page with copyright notice" title="Page with copyright notice" style="border:1px solid gray; margin: 10px 5px;"></img>
    <div>Page With Copyright Notice</div>
  </figure>
 </div>
 
2. Upload this site to your Netlify account.
3. Create the following web site and upload to your Netlify account.
    1. Here, we are presenting a mock up.
 
     <div>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tech-career-booster-courses/01-full-stack-web-developer/sections/01-html-and-css/chapters/21-images/assets/images/task-for-images-mock-up.png"
            alt="Site with 4 images" title="Site with 4 images" style="border:1px solid gray; margin: 10px 5px;"></img>
        <div>Images Task - Site with 4 Images</div>
      </figure>
     </div>
     
    2. You should implement a site that satisfies the above mock up.
    3. Make sure that when the user moves his mouse over any of the images, the image
    opacity is decreased by 30%.
    4. Use any list of images that you want.
    5. The images should be downloaded and stored locally on your site.
    This is a sample implementation:
   
     <div>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tech-career-booster-courses/01-full-stack-web-developer/sections/01-html-and-css/chapters/21-images/assets/images/images-task-web-site-with-beautiful-landscapes.jpg"
            alt="Task with Images" title="Task With Images" style="border:1px solid gray; margin: 10px 5px;"></img>
        <div>Task With Images</div>
      </figure>
     </div>
     
    6. Images width and height should be fixed and the same for all images.
    7. The images should be links to the google map point of the landscape that you have selected. For example, this
    is the link "https://www.google.gr/maps/place/Thasos/@40.6846043,24.578337,12z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x14aeee9e0e1bd2e3:0xd4df10b4678755dc"
    for the first image (top-left) of the sample above.
