Read all the instructions here, before you start implementing your task.

1. Create a set of 4 pages that would belong to the same site.
2. All pages should have a navigation bar at the top with 4 links to each page.
3. Pages should be:
    1. Products, inside the `main.html`
    2. Pricing, inside the `sections/pricing.html`
    3. About, inside the `sections/about.html`
    4. Contact, inside the `sections/contact.html`
4. The content of each page, below the top navigation bar, should have a header `<h2>`
and a paragraph `<p>` with the main text. `<h2>` should contain the name of the page so that we
know which page we have visited. The content of the `<p>` can be any dummy (e.g. Lorem ipsum...) text.
You can enclose any element into any `<div>` element, if you want.
5. Style the links of the navigation bar as follows:
    1. Links should not be underlined.
    2. The current page should be highlighted.
    3. On mouse over the link should be highlighted with a highlight mode different from the one used for current page.
    4. **Don't** use the same colors as the ones we used for the pages we built while studying the chapter.
    5. **Don't** use the class `current-page-link`. Use the class `active-page` instead.
6. The style sheet rules should exist inside a file `stylesheets/main.css`.
7. Write inside your CSS file, comments that explain what each rule is doing.
8. Here is what your site might look like:
