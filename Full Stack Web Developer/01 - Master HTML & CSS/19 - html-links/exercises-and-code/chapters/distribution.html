      <p>
        Widely distributed across Asia in its native range, Perovskia atriplicifolia grows in western China,[4] Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran,[37]
        Turkey, and parts of eastern Europe.[38] It is found in steppes and on hillsides,[38] and grows at higher elevations in mountainous regions,
        including the Himalayas.[39] It has been recorded at 10,000 ft (3,000 m) of altitude in the Karakoram.[40] In Pakistan's Quetta district,
        it is often found in association with the grass Chrysopogon aucheri,[41] and may serve as an indicator species for soils with low calcium
        carbonate and chloride availability.[42] The harsh habitats preferred by P. atriplicifolia are comparable to the sagebrush steppe of North America.[43]

        In parts of its range, such as the Harboi, these steppe ecosystems are employed as rangeland for grazing animals such as sheep and goats, although
        this forage is generally of poor nutritional quality. P. atriplicifolia can serve as an important source of phosphorus and zinc,[44] despite being
        high in poorly-digested material such as neutral detergent fiber and lignin
