      <p>
        Perovskia atriplicifolia is a deciduous perennial subshrub with an erect to spreading habit.[13][27] Superficially, it resembles a much
        larger version of lavender.[28] Multiple branches arise from a shared rootstalk,[8] growing to a height of 0.5–1.2 m (1 ft 8 in–3 ft 11 in),
        [8][22] with occasional specimens reaching 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in).[4] The mature plant may be 0.6–1.2 m (2 ft 0 in–3 ft 11 in) across.[4]
        The rigid stems are square in cross-section,[4] and are covered by a indumentum formed by stellate, or star-shaped, trichomes and oil droplets.[27]
        Especially during autumn, these hairs give the stems a silvery appearance.[29]

        The grayish-green leaves are arranged in opposite pairs,[13][30] and attached to the stems by a short petiole.[27] They are generally 3–5 cm
        (1.2–2.0 in) long and 0.8–2 cm (0.3–0.8 in) wide,[27] although narrower in some populations.[8] The overall leaf shape is oblate, a rounded
        shape longer than it is wide, to lanceolate, shaped like the head of a lance.[27] They are pinnatipartite,[8] with a deeply incised
        leaf margin that may be either wavy or sharp-toothed; even within a single community of P. atriplicifolia, there can be considerable
        variation in the details of leaf shape.[27] Leaves near the top of branches may merge into bracts.[27] The foliage is aromatic,
        especially when crushed,[4] with a fragrance described as sage-like,[5] a blend of sage and lavender,[16] or like turpentine.[31]

        The flowering season of P. atriplicifolia can be as long as June through October,[27] although populations in some parts of its range,
        such as China, may bloom in a much more restricted period.[8] The inflorescence is a showy panicle, 30–38 cm (12–15 in) long,[4] with
        many branches.[32] Each of these branches is a raceme, with the individual flowers arranged in pairs called verticillasters.[8] Each
        flower's calyx is purple, densely covered in white or purple hairs, and about 4 mm long. The corolla is tube-shaped, formed from a
        four-lobed upper lip and a slightly shorter lower lip; the blue or violet blue petals are about 1 cm long.[8][32] The style has been
        reported in both an exserted—extending beyond the flower's tube—form and one contained within the flower;[32] all known examples of P.
        atriplicifolia in cultivation have exserted styles.[13] Gardening author Neil Soderstrom describes the appearance of the flowers from a
        distance as "like a fine haze or fog".[33]

        Fruits develop about a month after flowering,[8] and consist of dark brown oval nutlets, about 2 mm × 1 mm.
