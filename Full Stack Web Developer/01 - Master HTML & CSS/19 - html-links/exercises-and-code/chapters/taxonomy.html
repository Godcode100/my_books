      <h2>Taxonomy</h2>

      <p>
        Perovskia atriplicifolia was described by George Bentham in 1848, based on a specimen collected by William Griffith in Afghanistan,[1]
        now preserved at the Kew Gardens herbarium as the species's holotype.[2] The specific epithet atriplicifolia means "with leaves like Atriplex",
        [3] referring to its similarity to saltbush.[4] Commonly known as Russian sage, P. atriplicifolia is neither native to Russia nor a member of
        Salvia,[5] the genus generally referred to as sage.[6]

      <p>
        A Chinese population was described as a separate species in 1987 and given the name Perovskia pamirica,[7] but has since been considered
        synonymous with P. atriplicifolia.

        Within the family Lamiaceae, the large genus Salvia had long been believed monophyletic, based on the structure of its stamina.
        Several smaller genera, including Dorystaechas, Perovskia, and Meriandra were also included in tribe Mentheae, but were thought
        more distantly related. In 2004, a molecular phylogenetics study based on two cpDNA genes (rbcL and trnL-F) demonstrated that
        Salvia is not monophyletic, but comprises three identifiable clades. Clade I is more closely related to Perovskia than to other
        members of Salvia.[11]

        P. atriplicifolia has been the subject of subsequent studies seeking to clarify the relationships within Mentheae. Further research
        combined palynological analysis of pollen grains with rbcL sequencing to provide additional support for the relationship between
        Perovskia and Salvia clade I. It also distinguished between P. atriplicifolia and P. abrotanoides, while confirming their close
        relationship.[12] A subsequent multigene study (four cpDNA markers and two nrDNA markers) redrew parts of the Mentheae cladogram,
        making Rosmarinus a sister group to Perovskia.

      <p>
        Several cultivars of P. atriplicifolia have been developed. They are primarily distinguished by the height of mature plants and the depth
        of the leaf-margin incisions.[13] Many of these cultivars, especially those with deeply incised leaves, may actually be hybrids of P.
        atriplicifolia and P. abrotanoides.[13][14] In that context, some may be referred to by the hybrid name P. Ã—hybrida.[14][15]

        The most common cultivar,[16] 'Blue Spire', is among those suspected of being a hybrid.[17][18] It was selected from German plantings
        by the British Notcutts Nurseries, and first exhibited in 1961.[19][20] 'Blue Spire' grows to approximately 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in), and
        has large, darker blue flowers.[5][17] In 1993, it received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[21]

        'Filigran' reaches a height of 1.2 to 1.3 m (3 ft 11 in to 4 ft 3 in); this tall, sturdy cultivar's name is German for filigree,
        in reference to its lacy, fern-like foliage.[5][19] 'Little Spire' is shorter, with a mature height of only 0.6 m (2 ft 0 in).[16][22]
        'Longin' is similar in height to 'Blue Spire' but more upright.[5] Allan Armitage established the late-flowering cultivar 'Mystery of
        Knightshayes' from a plant at Knightshayes Court.[19] Other cultivars include 'Blue Haze', 'Blue Mist', 'Hybrida' (also called 'Superba'),
        'Lace', 'Lisslit', 'Rocketman', and 'WALPPB'
