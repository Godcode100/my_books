      <p>
        Perovskia atriplicifolia (/pəˈrɒvskiə ætrɪplɪsɪˈfoʊliə/), commonly called Russian sage, is a flowering herbaceous perennial plant
        and subshrub. Although not a member of Salvia, the genus of other plants commonly called sage, it is closely related to them.
        It has an upright habit, typically reaching 0.5–1.2 m (1 ft 8 in–3 ft 11 in) tall, with square stems and grey-green leaves that
        yield a distinctive odor when crushed. It is best known for its flowers. Its flowering season extends from mid-summer to late October,
        with blue to violet blossoms arranged into showy, branched panicles.
