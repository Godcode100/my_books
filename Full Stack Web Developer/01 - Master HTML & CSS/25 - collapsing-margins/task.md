1. Implement the following page:

 ./images/<div>
  ./images/<figure>
    ./images/<img src="http://tech-career-booster-courses.s3.amazonaws.com/01-full-stack-web-developer/sections/01-html-and-css/chapters/25-collapsing-margins/assets/images/page-with-two-images-with-vertical-margins.jpg"
        alt="Task For Vertical Collapsing Margins" title="Task For Vertical Collapsing Margins" style="border:1px solid gray; margin: 10px 5px;">./images/</img>
    ./images/<div>Task For Vertical Collapsing Margins./images/</div>
  ./images/</figure>
 ./images/</div>
 
2. Watch out about the following:
    1. The pictures have some fixed space in between them.
    2. There is some blank space above the top picture.
    3. There is some blank space below the bottom picture.
    4. The pictures are displayed in the center of the horizontal direction.
    5. Both pictures have same fixed width and height.
3. You need to implement the above page in 2 versions
    1. Version 1: Using a hack to preserve vertical margins
    2. Version 2: Without using vertical margins on both directions
