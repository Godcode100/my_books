1. Implement a web page like the following:
 
 ./images/<div>
  ./images/<figure>
    ./images/<img src="http://tech-career-booster-courses.s3.amazonaws.com/01-full-stack-web-developer/sections/01-html-and-css/chapters/24-css-units/assets/images/task-for-css-units.jpg"
        alt="Page with Various Font Sizes" title="Page with Various Font Sizes" style="border:1px solid gray; margin: 10px 5px;">./images/</img>
    ./images/<div>Task: Page with Various Font Sizes./images/</div>
  ./images/</figure>
 ./images/</div>
 
2. Make sure about the following:
    1. Use only relative units for the font sizes
    2. Use the trick that is described in the chapter content in order to make the relative units easy to calculate.
    3. The `h1` font size needs to be 32px.
    4. The `h2` font size needs to be 28px.
    5. The `p` font size needs to be 18px.
    6. The `li` font size needs to be 14px.
3. Having implemented the above, upload to your Netlify account.
4. Change the CSS rule for `li` to be using `em` instead of `rem`. What do you notice? Is everything ok? If not, why?
