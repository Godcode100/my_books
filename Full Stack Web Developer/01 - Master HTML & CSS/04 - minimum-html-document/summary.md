We are also going to talk about character encoding, ASCII, Extended ASCII and UTF-8.
Specifying the character encoding will make sure that the browser is interpreting and displaying special characters correctly.

<div id="media-container-image-Characters Encoding">
  <div id="media-title-image-Characters Encoding">Characters Encoding</div>

       style="float: left; width: 150px;"/> 
</div>

We are also going to talk about the `meta` tag and the `title` tag.

Finally, we are going to build another simple web page like this:
