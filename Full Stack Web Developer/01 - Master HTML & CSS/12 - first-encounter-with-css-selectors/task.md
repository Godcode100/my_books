1. Create an HTML page as the one below:

  <div id="media-container-image-Task: First Encounter With CSS Selectors">
    <div id="media-title-image-Task: First Encounter With CSS Selectors">Task: First Encounter With CSS Selectors</div>
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tech-career-booster-courses/01-full-stack-web-developer/sections/01-html-and-css/chapters/12-first-encounter-with-css-selectors/assets/images/task-for-first-encounter-with-css-rules.png"
          alt="Task First Encounter With CSS Selectors" title="Task First Encounter With CSS Selectors" style="border:1px solid gray; margin: 10px 5px;"></img>
  </div>
  
2. The actual content of your HTML page should be this:

   ```
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <link href="stylesheets/main.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
        <title>Task for CSS Selectors</title>
      </head>
    
      <body>
    
        <h6>Politics</h6>
    
        <h1>Fuming over Ryan, some conservative voices turn on the Freedom Caucus</h1>
    
        <p>
          Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) has been able to count on his Facebook page for stalwart support during his long-running
          battle with the House Republican leadership, including a successful effort to oust House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).
        </p>
    
        <p>
          “Keep up the great work,” read a comment posted last week. “We the people thank you for ridding us of John Boehner!”
        </p>
    
        <footer>
          <h6>David Weigel contributed to this report.</h6>
        </footer>
    
      </body>
    
    </html>
    ```

3. Send your work to your mentor for approval.
