    <h2>Extract 1</h2>

    <p>
    Curley stepped over to Lennie like a terrier.  'What the hell you laughin' at?’
    </p>

    <p>
    Lennie looked blankly at him.  'Huh?’
    </p>

    <p>
    Then Curley's rage exploded.  'Come on, ya big bastard.  Get up on your feet.  No big son-of-a-bitch is gonna laugh at me.  I'll show you who's yella.'
    </p>

    <p>
    Lennie looked helplessly at George, and then he got up and tried to retreat.  Curley was balanced and poised.
      He slashed at Lennie with his left, and then smashed down his nose with a right.  Lennie gave a cry of terror.
      Blood welled from his nose.
      'George,' he cried.
      'Make 'um let me alone, George.'  He backed until he was against the wall, and Curley followed, slugging him in the face.
      Lennie's hands remained at his sides; he was too frightened to defend himself.

    <p>
    George was on his feet yelling, 'Get him, Lennie.  Don't let him do it.'
    </p>

    <p>
    Lennie covered his face with his huge paws and bleated with terror.  He cried, 'Make 'um stop, George.'
    Then Curley attacked his stomach and cut off his wind.
