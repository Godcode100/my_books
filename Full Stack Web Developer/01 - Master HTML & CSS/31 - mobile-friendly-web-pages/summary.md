With the advent of tablets and mobile devices, Web page designers faced a serious problem. They had to make their
Web pages look good on small displays. They had to design their Web pages to be responsive. In this chapter you
will learn how to create responsive Web pages.

A page like this:

![./images/Web Page displayed on Desktop](./images/web-page-displayed-on-desktop.jpg)

might look good on the desktop computer display. But how can we make it look good on the mobile device too, like this?

We are going to teach you how you will adapt the layout of your page. For example, a page like this:

![./images/Page with Sports Info](./images/page-with-sports-info.jpg)

will be converted to a page like this, when viewed on a mobile device. I.e. a 3-column layout will be converted to a 1-column layout:

![./images/Sports Page Looking Good On Mobile Device](./images/sports-page-on-apple-iphone-6-device-with-responsive-css.jpg)

Or it may be turned automatically to a 2-column layout on tablets:

![./images/2-column Layout For Google Nexus 10](./images/sports-page-with-2-column-layout-on-google-nexus-10.jpg)

You will learn how the following page that has 4-columns layout on a big screen:

![./images/Responsive Page with Hotel Images - 4-columns layout](./images/task-responsive-web-page-with-hotel-images-4-columns-layout.jpg)

is automatically turned to a 3-columns layout on medium-sized screens:

![./images/Responsive Page with Hotel Images - 3-columns layout](./images/task-responsive-web-page-with-hotel-images-3-columns-layout.jpg)

is automatically turned to a 2-columns layout on small-sized screens:

![./images/Responsive Page with Hotel Images - 2-columns layout](./images/task-responsive-web-page-with-hotel-images-2-columns-layout.jpg)

and is automatically turned to a 1-column layout on extra small screens:
