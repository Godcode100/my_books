      New Zealand (/njuːˈzilənd/ new-zee-lənd, Māori: Aotearoa [aɔˈtɛaɾɔa]) is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises
      two main landmasses – that of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Māui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamu – and numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated
      some 1,500 kilometres (900 mi) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1,000 kilometres (600 mi) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia,
      Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long isolation, New Zealand developed a distinctive
      biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic
      uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.

      Polynesians settled in the islands that were to become New Zealand somewhere between 1250 and 1300 CE, and developed a distinctive Māori culture. In 1642, Abel
      Tasman, a Dutch explorer, became the first European to sight New Zealand.[11] In 1840, representatives of the British Crown and Māori Chiefs signed the Treaty
      of Waitangi, making New Zealand a British colony. Today, the majority of New Zealand's population of 4.5 million is of European descent; the indigenous Māori
      are the largest minority, followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders. Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture is mainly derived from Māori and early British settlers,
      with recent broadening arising from increased immigration. The official languages are English, Māori and New Zealand Sign Language, with English predominant.
