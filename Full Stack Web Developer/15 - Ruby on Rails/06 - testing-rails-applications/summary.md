![./images/Rails Testing](./images/rails-testing.png)

Ruby on Rails projects have the test automation built into their hearts. Actually, it is built into Ruby on Rails framework itself.
This chapter is a must study, difficult chapter, that teaches you the main testing techniques that you may encounter in your professional
life with Ruby on Rails. You will learn how to implement model tests, integration tests and system tests. `RSpec` and `Cucumber` are 
also added to the scene so that you know how these tools are integrated with RoR. Again, this is a chapter that you need to master
very well in order to be competent Web developer.
