Your student needs to cover `blog` application using tests and according to requirements in the task description.
This is not an easy task and takes a lot of effort from the student. We aim to make them practice both in Rails tests,
and in RSpec and Cucumber.

**Important** Make sure that your student uploads his work to their Github account.
