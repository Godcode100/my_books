## Task A

All the email integration described in the chapter for your `blog` application needs to be pushed to your remote Github
repository and deployed to your production Heroku application.

## Task B

Continue working on the e-shop that you have started since the beginning of this section. You need to make sure that you 
offer the same email-related features that we have developed for `blog` in this chapter:

1. Users should confirm their email address.
1. Users should be able to ask for the email to confirm their email address to be resent.

Push your code to your remote Github repository and to your production Heroku e-shop application.
