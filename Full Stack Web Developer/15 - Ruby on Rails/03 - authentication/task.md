## Task A

All the work that is described in the chapter content needs to be accomplished and pushed to your Github account.
Also, it needs to be public using Heroku.

## Task B

Continue the development on the e-shop you started in the previous chapter. All the things that you have learned
for the session-based authentication needs to be applied. For example:

1. You need to create a User model.
1. You need to implement the Sign Up feature.
1. You need to implement the Sign In feature.
1. You need to make sure that you have links to ease the navigation in the e-shop.
1. You need to display the email of the user currently logged in.
1. You need to implement the Sign Out feature.
1. You need to make sure that actions in controllers are not called if not applicable.
1. You need to reduce the code duplication both at the view level and at the controller level.
1. Product view pages should be public. Whereas Product creation/editing/deletion pages should require authentication.

Make sure that you commit your code to your Github account and that you deploy it to your production server in Heroku too.
