# Task B

You need to make sure that you have implemented in your `blog` application the things that the chapter teaches you. Indicatively:

1. Create the `SignUpConfirmationEmailJob` and make the email being delivered asynchronously.
1. Install and use the Delayed Job with the ActiveRecord adapter.
1. Set the queue to be `low_priority`.
1. Write sample code for all the callbacks.
1. Write at least one test for your job.

**Important:** Upload your work to your Github account. Also, when you deploy your work to Heroku make sure that you understand
whether you are charged or not for your background workers.
