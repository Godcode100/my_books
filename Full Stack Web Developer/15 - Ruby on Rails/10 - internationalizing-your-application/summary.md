![./images/Internationalization With Rails - Summary](./images/rails-internationalization-summary.jpg)

Although English is a very popular language, we would like to make our Web application to support multiple languages, like French, Spanish, German, Chinese and more.
Rails has fantastic support for internationalizing your application, both with regards to the strings that need to be translated, but also with regards to
how dates and currencies should be displayed. Also, Rails allows you to display time related information using your Users' time zone, which is an awesome feature.
All these things you are going to learn and practice in this chapter. You will apply them to your blog application.
