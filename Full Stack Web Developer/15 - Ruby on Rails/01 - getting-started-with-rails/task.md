**Important** About the apps developed during the chapter content study:

1. If you haven't done so, you need to upload the `hello_rails` and `blog` application code to your Github account.
2. If you haven't done so, you need to publish the `blog` application to your Heroku account and create a public Web application for demo purposes.

## Task A

1. Create a welcome page for the `blog` application, like you did for the `hello_rails` application.
1. Make sure that you commit your work and push it to remote repository.
1. Also push your work to your Heroku production server.

## Task B

This is going to be the first part of a larger Rails project that you will build while taking the Ruby on Rails section chapters. It will be an e-shop.

In this chapter we start with the main resource, i.e. the `Product`. You will have to build a Rails application that will allow the user to
CRUD Products. 

The Product needs to have the following properties:

1. code. A string.
1. display_name. A string.
2. display_description. A text.

Make sure that you also have a welcome page.

You need to integrate your e-shop with Twitter Bootstrap.

Don't forget to push your code to a new Github repository and to a new Heroku project in production.
