**Important** About the apps developed during the chapter content study:

1. Your student needs to upload the `hello_rails` and `blog` application code to their Github account.
2. Your student needs to publish the `blog` application to their Heroku account and create a public Web application for demo purposes.

### Task A

Make sure that your student creates a welcome page for the `blog` application. It needs to be in their Github account and pushed
to live Heroku production server.

### Task B

Make sure that your student creates the e-shop application as per the requirements. You can get a sample implementation here:

Make sure that the student uploads their work to Github and to Heroku.
